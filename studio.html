                  R. Craig Cox earned his Bachelor of Science in Architecture (1989) and Master of Architecture (1992) degrees from Clemson University. His extensive travel in Europe has increased his awareness and appreciation of timeless residential architecture. He returned home to North Augusta, SC where he worked for Sandeford and Webb Architects learning the craft of custom single family homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1994 he moved to Charlotte, NC and worked for David Furman Architecture for nine years continuing his experience in residential design. Craig became a licensed Architect in 1997. Cox Architecture and Design was organized in February of 2003 with the goal of creating unique and inviting homes while exceeding homeowner expectations.

                  Gregory's interest in architecture began while working at a hometown firm in Portland, Maine. He grew up in a small coastal community along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and after receiving his high school diploma, he was ready to dive into city life. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture (2010) and a Master of Architecture (2012) from Judson University, just outside of Chicago, Illinois.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dedicated to his first job at an architectural office in Portland, Gregory often returned to Maine during winter and summer breaks to work as a recurring intern. The firm specialized in oceanfront restaurants, urban revitalization studies, academic buildings, and fire-rescue/police stations. In the fall of 2014, Gregory relocated to Charlotte in search of warmer weather and a strong sense of Southern hospitality. He has enjoyed calling the Queen City home ever since, and continues to explore the region's architectural landscape and cultural offerings.

                  Raymond grew up in Maryland and South Carolina with an early appreciation for art, craftsmanship, and history. This interest naturally led him to study Historic Preservation and Community Planning at the College of Charleston (2019), followed by a Master of Architecture from Clemson University (2022). After moving to Charlotte following graduation, he quickly connected with the city's energy and design culture and joined the team in early 2025.
                </p>
                <p>
                  His experience in both commercial and residential architecture, along with his preservation background, has shaped a thoughtful approach to designing with context. Raymond believes a home should be both a retreat and a reflection of its inhabitants: visually inspiring, grounded in comfort, and responsive to the way people truly live. He finds deep satisfaction in the complete design process, especially the journey from early sketches to real, lived-in spaces that feel both intentional and enduring.
